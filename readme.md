##ACCESS TO DATASETS I USED IS IN THE DATA FOLDER - Manually load them into your computer

The data sets can be accessed through the websites referenced, however, to access the exact data, use the datasets attached in the zip file. 

All plots and images are saved through VSCode -> tested the code on R Studio and some of the code may output different graphs as in the coursework, but should appear the same as in submission when the code is run on VSCode and saved onto computer. I've added all the plot pngs into the png folder.

the saved final merged data folder includes the merged data sets that i saved for checkpoints during the code (fred api etc. took hours to load). The absolute final merged dataset is called final_data.csv 
please also load this onto your computer for the rest of the code to work (or write the csv onto your computer)

Thank you.
